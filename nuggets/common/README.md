This folder contains the library for the Nuggest project, notably game, player, and grid.
In terms of testing, it is not really necessary here as the modules are relatively simple and 
will be tested in the main makefile test as well. However, just to confirm the visibilty of players
is correctly implemented, I wrote test.c and then with valgrind, I confirmed the implementation here has no issues
